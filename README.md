</div>

## What Is This?:

This project is a simple work scheduler to show case my work as a programmer, and help improve my programming skills. 

## Relevant Information:

This webpage and program is my second project dealing heavily in javascript. It is a work scheduler that allows you to enter tasks or other items into the specific hour block in the workday. The scheduler includes the current and running date and time and is meant to be used in the current day. The save button allows the user to save entries to local storage it will also disable the text area to prevent accidently modifying the entry. When the user reloads the page the saved entries will display in the block they were saved. I have also included an edit button that when clicked will enable the text area again to allow modification of entries. Alerts inform the user if they try to save an empty entry, if the user tries to save an entry that is already saved, and a message appears when the user has successfully saved an entry.
